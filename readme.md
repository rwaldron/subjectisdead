"@miketaylr "[Subject] is dead, long live [Subject]" blog titles are dead, long live "[Subject] is dead, long live [Subject]" blog titles!"

So, yeah... add yours.

Here's what you do:

1. If a dir for the language you want to use doesn't exist, create it. If not, then skip to #2
2. Create a file in the dir of the language you intend to use
3. In that file, write a program:
	- For the given string "[Subject] is dead, long live [Subject]"
	- Create an infinite loop, each time replacing "[Subject]" with "[Subject] is dead, long live [Subject]"
	- Print the new string
4. Record the results of the crash with a screen shot

Multiple approaches for the same language are welcome! Just give yours a different name and add the instructions to the readme in that directory. \BOOM/
